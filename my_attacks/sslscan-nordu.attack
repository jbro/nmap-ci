Feature: Run sslscan against a target

Background:
  And the following profile:
    | name     | value      |
    | hostname | www.nordu.net |

Scenario: Ensure no low-security ciphers with short keys
  When I launch a "generic" attack with:
    """
    sslscan <hostname>:443
    """
  Then the output should not contain:
    """
    56 bits
    """
